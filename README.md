DELI-cious Java Capstone Project
DELI-cious is a Java-based capstone project developed to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming, design patterns, and application development. The project is structured following standard Java conventions and is organized under the com.pluralsight package. It wallows the user to create an order that contains a sandwich, chips if the user inclines, and a drink if the user inclines.

Any user is welcome to create a new order within the DELI App.
The user will be asked if they want to make a new order. Then they can choose what they would like to add to the order. If they choose sandwich, they build that sandwich out from they size of the sandwich and the bread type. They can include whatever meat and cheese they want and if they want extra they can add it too. 
When they are ready to purchase the order will be printede in front of them on a receipt and the receipt will be added to the receipts folder.
