DELI-cious Java Capstone Project
DELI-cious is a console-based Java application developed as a capstone project to demonstrate proficiency in object-oriented programming, design patterns, and application development. The application allows users to create customized deli orders, including sandwiches with various options, chips, and drinks.

This code up above was probably my most interesting piece of code. This allowed the user to constantly pick however many toppings they wanted. It would ask them to choose which
toppings they wanted until they werew finish with toppings.
